                <p class="intro-paragraph">Started working from home during the pandemic. 
                    At first, I loved it: I loved having eggs on the stove while I was answering emails. I loved eating a hot lunch most days. My commute was already short, but it was nice to "go into work" with wet hair sometimes.</p>
